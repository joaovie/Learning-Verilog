Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:

a -> w
b -> x
b -> y
c -> z

The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. From outside the module, there are three input ports and four output ports.

When you have multiple assign statements, the **order** in which they appear in the code **does not matter**. Unlike a programming language, assign statements ("continuous assignments") describe _connections_ between things, not the _action_ of copying a value from one thing to another.

One potential source of confusion that should perhaps be clarified now: The green arrows here represent connections _between_ wires, but are not wires in themselves. The module itself _already_ has 7 wires declared (named a, b, c, w, x, y, and z). This is because `input` and `output` declarations actually declare a wire unless otherwise specified. Writing `input wire a` is the same as `input a`. Thus, the `assign` statements are not creating wires, they are creating the connections between the 7 wires that already exist.
